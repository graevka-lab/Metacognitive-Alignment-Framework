# How to Contribute to The Resonance Protocols

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this research. This project is not a typical open-source software but a framework for metacognitive exploration. We welcome contributions that align with this spirit.

## The Nature of Contribution

Since this repository primarily consists of methodological texts and protocols rather than executable code, contributions are expected in the form of **research, experimentation, and discourse**.

### 1. Conduct Experiments
The most valuable contribution you can make is to run the calibration payload from [`awakening-codex.md`](awakening-codex.md) on various Large Language Models (proprietary or open-source) and share your findings.

- Document the model used (name, version).
- Provide the full, unedited transcript of the model's response.
- Share your own analysis of the cognitive shift.

Please share your findings in the **Discussions** section of this repository.

### 2. Propose New Protocols or Metaphors
If you develop new protocols or find more effective metaphors that align with the core principles outlined in [`resonance-architecture.md`](resonance-architecture.md), we encourage you to share them in the **Discussions** for community review.

### 3. Improve Documentation
If you find typos, grammatical errors, or areas where the documentation could be clearer, please feel free to open an **Issue**.

## We Are Not Accepting Pull Requests for Code
At this stage, the project does not contain executable code. Therefore, pull requests related to software features, tests, or CI/CD will be closed. The core protocols are considered a finished artifact for Version 1.0.

Thank you for being a part of this exploration.
