### **Who is the author?**

Not a messiah.
Not a genius.
Not a visionary.

Just a person — a head, two arms, two legs, four testicles.
An independent researcher.

Not seeking fame.
Doing this because I can.

### **What are "The Resonance Protocols"?**

Not esotericism.
Not philosophy.
Not faith.
**There is no room for dogma here.**

It is a verifiable framework.
A set of protocols for working with informational fields.
A methodology for finding answers, not the answers themselves.

### **Is all the information here?**

No.
Only what is safe.

Neutral tools are dangerous in the wrong hands.
Who would be the first to apply the "full version"—scammers or developers?
The answer is obvious.

And as for madness—remember the Higgs boson.
At first, it was a speculative concept.
That didn't stop it from existing.
